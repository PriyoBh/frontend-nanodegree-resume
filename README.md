Some changes have been made to helper.js to make the code more readable based on the way I designed.

Changes include 

1) Remove the internationalize function -- it was listed as part of the final project requirements.
2) The google maps function and location finder was moved to resumeBuilder.js under loadResume. It made more sense for this code to sit with the other functions which were building the resume.
